    "In recent years the PEST software suite has become the industry standard for calibrating groundwater flow models and evaluating uncertainty in their predictions. PEST has many advantages, including the ability to robustly handle highly parameterized models with thousands of observations and parameters, as well as numerous  utility programs to perform ancillary analyses and facilitate use with popular modeling software such as MODFLOW. The use of PEST presents many challenges, however, especially in the highly parameterized context. Calibration of a highly parameterized model typically requires managing large volumes of information spread across numerous input and output files. This information can provide valuable insight to the modeler, but can be difficult or impossible to effectively visualize without custom programming. PESTools aims to provide a central platform for managing and visualizing this information, which minimizes the number of intermediate files and custom code required for parameter estimation workflows.\n"
